\begin{lfbox}[Learning Objectives]

   By the end of this session, you should be able to:

   \begin{itemize}
      \item
      List the primary (inter-related) considerations and
      tasks involved in memory tuning.
      \item
      Use entries in \filelink{/proc/sys/vm}, and decipher
      \filelink{/proc/meminfo}.
      \item
      Use \textbf{vmstat} to display information about memory,
      paging, I/O, processor activity, and processes' memory
      consumption.
      \item
      Understand how \textbf{swap} areas are used, and how
      to create, monitor and regulate them.
      \item
      Understand how the \textbf{OOM-killer} decides when to
      take action and selects which processes should be
      exterminated to open up some memory

   \end{itemize}
